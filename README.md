# MetaboGNN

MetaboGNN is a Graph Neural Network-based framework for predicting liver metabolic stability using molecular graph representations and cross-species experimental data.

This code was developed as part of our study:  
**"MetaboGNN: Predicting Liver Metabolic Stability with Graph Neural Networks and Cross-Species Data"**  
(submitted to *Journal of Cheminformatics*)

## üì¶ Installation

This project is tested and recommended to run on Ubuntu (Linux) environments with Python 3.9+ and GPU support.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qwon135/MetaboGNN.git
cd MetaboGNN
```
### ‚ö†Ô∏è CUDA Runtime Requirement

This project uses PyTorch with GPU acceleration, and requires:

- ‚úÖ NVIDIA GPU (with at least 6‚Äì8GB VRAM recommended)
- ‚úÖ Driver version ‚â• 520 (supports CUDA 11.8)
- ‚úÖ CUDA 11.8 Runtime

üí° Our experiments typically use 4‚Äì6GB of VRAM, but for stable training and inference, we recommend using a GPU with at least 8GB VRAM.

You do not need to install the full CUDA Toolkit ‚Äî the runtime only is enough.

‚úÖ You can check your driver version with:
```bash
nvidia-smi
```

üîó Download CUDA 11.8 Runtime:
- MetaboGNN is tested with CUDA 11.8. If `nvidia-smi` does not work or your driver is outdated, install the CUDA 11.8 runtime (used in our experiments) 
- here: üëâ https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive

### üß™ Environment Setup (with conda)

```bash
conda create -n metabo_gnn python=3.9
conda activate metabo_gnn

# Install PyTorch 2.1 + CUDA 11.8
conda install pytorch==2.1.2 pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia

# Install DGL with CUDA 11.8
conda install -c dglteam/label/th21_cu118 dgl

# Install PyTorch Geometric (PyG)
conda install conda-forge::pytorch_geometric
conda install pytorch-scatter=2.1.2 -c pyg
conda install pytorch-sparse=0.6.18 -c pyg

# üìù Note:
# Make sure the CUDA versions match across PyTorch, DGL, and PyG.
# If any installation fails, try upgrading pip & setuptools:
# python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
### 1. Pretraining

The dataset used for pretraining is not included in this repository due to licensing constraints and file size. However, it can be downloaded from the following link:

üìÅ [Download pretraining dataset](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vowev9pZtRBFOXA_zCN9YTLO9ECIKEV7?usp=sharing)

Please download the data.parquet file from the provided link and place it inside the GraphCL/ directory as shown below:
We also provide a pretrained model checkpoint (`GraphCL/gnn_pretrain.pt`) for users who wish to skip this step.

To perform self-supervised pretraining from scratch, run:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python GraphCL/pretrain.py
```

### 2. Fine-tuning Experiments

We provide three fine-tuning scenarios for ablation and comparison:

üöÄ Training the Models

```bash
python train.py --mode MetaboGNN # Main experiment: Fine-tuning pretrained GNN on cross-species metabolic stability task
python train.py --mode Scratch # Ablation: Training from scratch without pretraining for comparison
python train.py --mode Base # Representation-only: Evaluates pretrained GNN without cross-species fine-tuning
```
If you want to skip the training step and directly reproduce the inference results, you can download the pretrained model checkpoints from Google Drive:
üîó [Download checkpoints (ckpt.zip)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Vowev9pZtRBFOXA_zCN9YTLO9ECIKEV7?usp=sharing)
Unzip ckpt.zip into the project root directory so that the following structure is maintained:

```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ckpt/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025_MetaboGNN.pt
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025_Base.pt
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2025_Scratch.pt
```

üìà Evaluating Model Performance

After training, you can compare performance across the three models by running:

```bash
python infer.py

>> [   Scratch]  MLM RMSE: 29.09  |  HLM RMSE: 30.79
>> [      Base]  MLM RMSE: 28.39  |  HLM RMSE: 30.32
>> [ MetaboGNN]  MLM RMSE: 27.88  |  HLM RMSE: 28.39
```
This script loads the trained models (MetaboGNN, Base, and Scratch), evaluates them on a common test set, and generates a summary plot (Performance.png) that visualizes their performance.

### 3. Model Interpretability

We provide a Jupyter notebook that visualizes how the model interprets molecular structures, focusing on bond-level features.

- `edgeshaper.ipynb`: Highlights important chemical bonds based on attention weights or gradient-based signals.
  - Helps identify which bonds are most influential in predicting liver metabolic stability.
  - Requires a fine-tuned model (stored in the `ckpt/` directory).


### 4. Benchmark
We provide benchmarking experiments comparing MetaboGNN with prior methods such as MS_BACL and PredMS.
You can run the code in each subdirectory to reproduce the results, and the resulting performance plots are shown below.

We also include a Jupyter notebook, Performance_comparison.ipynb, which generates a comparative figure summarizing the results.

For details on each method, please refer to their original papers and official code repositories.

### 5. Predicting with run_predict.py
You can run **MetaboGNN** via command line using either a  **CSV file** or direct **SMILES** input.

#### üîç Option 1: Using SMILES strings
Use the --smiles flag with one or more comma-separated SMILES strings:

```bash
python run_predict.py --smiles "CC(C)NCC(COC1=CC=CC2=CC=CC=C21)O, CN1C=NC2=C1C(=O)N(C(=O)N2C)C" --save_dir ./outputs
```

  - Runs inference on SMILES input (e.g., propranolol and caffeine).
  - Prints results in the terminal and saves a timestamped CSV in ./outputs.


#### üîç Option 2: Using a CSV file
Use the --csv flag with a file containing a SMILES column:

```bash
python run_predict.py --csv ./data/test_paper.csv --save_dir ./outputs
```

  - Runs inference on all SMILES in the file.
  - Saves predictions to ./outputs, no console output.
