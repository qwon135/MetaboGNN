# MetaboGNN

MetaboGNN is a Graph Neural Network-based framework for predicting liver metabolic stability using molecular graph representations and cross-species experimental data.

This code was developed as part of our study:  
**"MetaboGNN: Predicting Liver Metabolic Stability with Graph Neural Networks and Cross-Species Data"**  
(submitted to *Journal of Cheminformatics*)

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

We recommend using Python 3.9+ and a virtual environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qwon135/MetaboGNN.git
cd MetaboGNN
pip install -r requirements.txt

If you are using conda:

conda create -n metabo_gnn python=3.9
conda activate metabo_gnn
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Run
### 1. Pretraining

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. python GraphCL/pretrain.py
```

### 2. Fine-tuning Experiments

We provide three fine-tuning scenarios for ablation and comparison:

```bash
python finetune.py
# Main experiment: Fine-tuning pretrained GNN on cross-species metabolic stability task

python finetune_scratch.py
# Ablation: Training from scratch without pretraining for comparison

python finetune_base.py
# Representation-only: Evaluates pretrained GNN without metabolic stability fine-tuning
```
